Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: To have control over when you are updating changes. You might make changes that you do not want to publish live to Gibhub. Likewise, you might not want every change that someone makes to a project that you are all working on together. 

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: Branches allow you to make changes within a project and go off in different directions with projects without fear of loosing your origional. Clones allow you to copy projects locally or off of GitHub onto your local machine. Forks copy a project from one GitHub repo to another.
Branches - Good for local projects
Clone - good for when you are working on a project with another person and need a copy of their code
Fork - when you want to modify and share another persons project but are not working with them.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: it allows you to determin if and when you want to merge as well as work on the most up to date version of the project

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A: Drop box or e-mailing files back and forth. There would not be the hastle of pulling and pushing, however, things would be a lot less organized and ther would be nothing to warn you that there was an error.

Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A: I would create a new branch when I wnated to make changes to code that could fundementally change the operation of master. If I wanted to explore a new feature, or even to mess with the base code I would make a new branch.
